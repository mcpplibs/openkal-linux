// that wrote to a closed stream did not receive the error the interface promises;
// it stopped, with a status no operation here produced and no wording anywhere in
// the specification.

// C library above this one answers `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)' --- openkal has no
// signals, so the library has nothing to set and truthfully reports success. The
// program is then killed anyway, four layers below the call it made to prevent
// exactly that. Exit 141 in a test whose own assertions never printed.
//
// ⇒ Ignored HERE and not there, because here is the only place that can: the
// interface has no operation a C library could use to say it. The write then
// fails with EPIPE, which `kal_stream_write' translates and reports, which is
// what the interface said would happen all along.
