// ⚠️⚠️ ONE CONSEQUENCE, AND IT IS NOT VISIBLE FROM THIS FILE. Standard input is
// therefore the handle ZERO, and `kal_spawn_streams` reserves zero to mean
// "the stream the parent has" (openkal/process.h). The two readings agree at
// position `in` --- placing standard input at standard input and inheriting it
// are the same act --- and cannot be told apart anywhere else, so a caller that
// places its own standard input at position `out` is asking for something that
// structure cannot express.
//
// The specification records the collision and what a caller should do about it;
// openkal-musl refuses that spawn rather than passing on a word that would be
// read as inheritance. An implementation MAY remove the ambiguity for every
// caller by not answering any stream enquiry with zero, and this one does not:
// packing these three would make a stream this implementation hands out
// different in kind from the descriptors `kal_fs_stream` and
// `kal_process_channel` report, and the interface has no operation that would
// unpack it for the caller.
